    "- Gradient Checking is slow! Approximating the gradient with $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta} \\approx  \\frac{J(\\theta + \\varepsilon) - J(\\theta - \\varepsilon)}{2 \\varepsilon}$ is computationally costly. For this reason, we don't run gradient checking at every iteration during training. Just a few times to check if the gradient is correct. \n",
    "- Gradient Checking, at least as we've presented it, doesn't work with dropout. You would usually run the gradient check algorithm without dropout to make sure your backprop is correct, then add dropout. "
