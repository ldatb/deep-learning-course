    "\n",
    "You are in charge of a special task: Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so choose wisely! \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily you're equipped with some deep learning now, and you will use it to save the day! Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into a dataset. To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! \n",

    "\n",
    "You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could begin to see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results! Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely -- not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! "
