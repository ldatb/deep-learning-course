    "Luckily you're equipped with some deep learning now, and you will use it to save the day! Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into a dataset. To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! \n",

    "    - Forward propagation to compute the loss function\n",
    "    - Backward propagation to compute the gradients with respect to the loss function\n",

    "You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could begin to see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results! Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely -- not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment used a relatively small dataset, so that you're able to train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the English language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favorite name is the great, the fierce, the undefeated: **Mangosaurus**!\n",

    "# BONUS: Writing like Shakespeare\n",
    "A similar task to character-level text generation (but more complicated) is generating Shakespearean poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of dinosaur names, you can use a collection of Shakespearean poems. Using LSTM cells, you can learn longer-term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character, much later in the sequence. These long-term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can implement a Shakespeare poem generator with Keras. Run the following cell to load the required packages and models. This may take a few minutes. "
